The COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm, introduced by J. E. Volder in 1959, is widely used for trigonometric computations. With parameter adjustments, it can also evaluate other transcendental functions such as exponentials, logarithms, and square roots. CORDIC is efficient and hardware-friendly, as it only requires additions, subtractions, bit shifts, and small table lookups. This makes it a low-cost and relatively fast approach compared to other methods. Different CORDIC architectures exist to address specific requirements: iterative designs minimize hardware area at the cost of throughput, while parallel and pipelined versions provide high speed and high throughput.
